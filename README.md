# MongoDB and VS Code (mongodb-vscode)
Learning about MongoDB Query Language (MQL) Using Visual Studio Code MongoDB extension. To learn about how work with MQL using MongoDB Shell or MongoDB Campus refer to my in-class PDF files. 

- MQL can also called MQ API for "MongoDB Query API".
- MQL allows us to perform CRUD operations. 
- MongoDB provides drivers for almost all the programming languages

## Using the MongoDB Queries
To continue with this tutorial, you need to have a MongoDB Atlas account. Please refer to my in-class PDF files of Using MongoDB and MongoDB Atlas for more details.
Notice that we can also practice MQL using using the free official GUI software from MongoDB which is [Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/tools/compass)". 

Please refer to the first part about "MongoDB" in my PDF file "Using MongoDB with Python" for more details.

Install the MongoDG extension:
- Click the Mongo icon to connect to your Atlas Database
